    "\n",
    "> We introduce a seller and buyer game involving two agents, one looking to sell a set of resources and one looking to buy them, similar to other approaches in the literature. We imbue agents with some beliefs about the object being sold, but unlike the ultimatum game, the seller and buyer game is an incomplete information game, i.e., players do not have complete information about other players (e.g., their beliefs). Only the seller is aware of the production cost of the object, and only the buyer is assigned and is aware of their willingness to pay for the object. Given these beliefs, the seller and the buyer are prompted to sell and buy the object, respectively. The seller starts first: reproducing a scenario in which the object is already on sale.\n",
